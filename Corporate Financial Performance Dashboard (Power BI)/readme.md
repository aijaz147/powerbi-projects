# Deutsche Bank Financial Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

### 🌟 Executive Financial Insights in One Click

This executive-grade financial dashboard, built in Power BI, delivers a unified view of performance across Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow dimensions.

While the dataset references Deutsche Bank, the dashboard structure is designed to be universally relevant — adaptable for corporates, SMEs, and startups alike.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Finance leaders (CFOs, controllers, managers) often struggle with:  
- Disconnected reporting across **P&L, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow**.  
- Too many numbers, not enough **storytelling**.  
- Difficulty linking **profits vs. cash reality**.  

**Goal:** Build a **single source of truth** that simplifies complex data into **decision-ready insights**.  

---

## 💡 Solution
An **interactive Power BI dashboard** that brings together:  
- 📌 **Executive Snapshot** — high-level KPIs & profitability story.  
- 📌 **P&L Deep Dive** — operating vs below-the-line cost drivers.  
- 📌 **Balance Sheet Health** — solvency & capital structure analysis.  
- 📌 **Cash Flow & Signals** — profit quality & liquidity signals.

## 🖼️ Dashboard Preview  

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Executive Snapshot** | KPI cards (Revenue, EBIT, Net Income, OCF) → Waterfall from Revenue → Net Income → Trend line Revenue vs Net Income → Smart narrative. |
| **2. P&L Deep Dive** | Stacked column of Expenses, Interest, Taxes → EBIT vs Net Income line → Matrix by Year/Quarter with conditional formatting. |
| **3. Balance Sheet Health** | Donut showing Liabilities vs Equity (% of Assets) → Equity trend line → Debt-to-Equity & ROA KPIs → Solvency signals. |
| **4. Cash Flow & Signals** | Dual line (OCF vs Net Income) → KPI indicators (OCF Coverage of EBIT, Cash Conversion Ratio) → Traffic-light signal for profit quality. |

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights
- **Data Modeling:** Star schema with Date table for time intelligence.  
- **DAX Measures:**  
  - YoY Growth (% Revenue, % Net Income)  
  - Operating Margin %, Net Margin %  
  - Debt-to-Equity, ROA %, OCF Coverage of EBIT, Cash Conversion Ratio  
  - Smart Narrative (`FORMAT` + `UNICHAR` for line breaks & storytelling)  
- **Visualization Design:**  
  - KPI cards with conditional colors & emojis  
  - Waterfall (Revenue → Expenses → EBIT → Net Income)  
  - Donut for capital structure (Liabilities vs Equity)  
  - Smart text narrative with arrows (↑ ↓) & percentage changes  
- **Executive Polish:**  
  - Clean layout with consistent titles/subtitles  
  - Color-coded (green ↑, red ↓) signals for instant interpretation  
  - Grid-free minimalism (CFO-friendly)

## 📈 Business Value
This dashboard enables decision makers to:  
- ✅ Track **profitability drivers** at a glance.  
- ✅ Assess **solvency** via Debt-to-Equity and ROA.  
- ✅ Compare **cash flow vs accounting profit** to detect risks early.  
- ✅ Move from **raw data → actionable insights** in seconds.

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out
- Not “just another Power BI project” → it mimics **real CFO dashboards**.  
- Covers the **3 core financial statements** (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow).  
- Goes beyond visuals → adds **narratives & signals** for storytelling.  
- Portfolio-ready for **freelancing (Fiverr/Upwork)** or **job interviews**.
